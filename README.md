# Image_classification_exercise
The task requires developing an image classification model with the aim to minimize the Half-Total Error Rate (HTER). A dataset consisting of 100k images along with a corresponding label file, both housed within a zip file, will serve as the basis for the model's training and evaluation. The images, named numerically, align with their binary labels presented line by line in the label file. The task requires preprocessing the images, splitting the dataset, designing, and training an appropriate image classification model such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model performance will be validated and iteratively improved until satisfactory HTER results are achieved. The final product will be a well-documented and robustly performing image classifier.
